In this repository you will find a web application and desktop application desing for the Erlete association. Now I am going to explain the functionality of them:
  
  # Desktop application
  This application is going to be used my the association's accountant. The user of this application will be able to administrate different things:
  
  First of all the administartor can see all user's information. In addition, it can create new members of Erlete. When a user is created it is going If any user doesn't want to be part of Erlete anymore, the accountant can unable them. If in any time thay want to return they can be enable again. If the association thinks any user is restricting the rules, the admin can enable them. Apart from this, the accountant can update user's information.
  
  Then, there is a part where you can see the cans (metal bins) the administration has, and in this moment which ones are being used. The accountant can also buy new cans by entering their information. 
  
  Moreover, in the bookings part, it is going to be displayed all the extractor's information. If the user can't go that day to the extractor, to produce honey, the booking can be deleted.
  
  Furthermore, the administrator can see all the financial movement of the association. 
  
  Finally, the admin can see if all user's fees (annual fee and commissions) have been payed or not.

The member will have the possibility of seeing its profile in a new page. If wanted, it will be able to change the DNI, name and surname. If it is wanted to change the password, the accountant will be in charge of that.

  - Book the extractor room the day wanted (if it is available). It will also be allowed to delete the booking.
  - First of all you have to enter the kg produced. Then it will be needed to choose the day the can is going to be used. It will let the user to choose cans until all the honey is entered in the cans.
